Road Accident Analysis Dashboard 🚦📊
Today I present to you my newest project, the Road Accident Analysis Dashboard, which will allow users to grasp critical insights about road accidents in 2021 and 2022. The dashboard attempts to comprehensively analyze key components to understand the issue of casualties better and how safe are the roads.
Project Overview:
🔹 Total Casualties Analysis, Fatal, serious, and minor injuries.
🔹 Casualties by Vehicle Type, Rating the most targeted groups.
🔹 Monthly Trends Comparison, Studying patterns of accidents in the two given years.
🔹 Casualties by Road Type & Surface Conditions, Defining zones of high accident occurrence.
🔹 Impact of Location & Time, Urban vs. rural distribution and effect of lighting conditions.
Technical Approach:
📌 It is created in Excel using pivot tables, charts, and data filters to extract user driven insights.
📌 The data was cleaned and transformed to meet the functional requirements of the end user.
